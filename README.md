# Advent of Code - TypeScript Solutions

I'm doing the Advent of Code for the first time. I'll try to upload my solutions here and will also make an effort to be very verbose, so the solutions will not be optimal in terms of performance and/or amount of code but are rather intended to be easily readable and understandable.

## Running a solution

You can do e.g. `bun 2023/1.ts`. This will require [Bun](https://bun.sh/).
